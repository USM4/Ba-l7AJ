**ðŸ–¥ Backend (Django API)**
Single Vendor Focus:
Only one vendor (Ba L7aj), so no need for complex vendor management.
Focus on order management, real-time updates, and payment processing.
API Endpoints:
Method	Endpoint	Functionality
POST	/auth/signup/	User registration (JWT)
POST	/auth/login/	User login (JWT)
GET	/menu/	List of available dishes
POST	/order/	Place an order (add items to cart)
GET	/order/:id/	Get order status (via WebSockets for real-time updates)
POST	/payment/	Confirm payment (cash on delivery or online payment)
Models:
Order: Contains order details (user, items, status, total).
User: User profile (JWT authentication).
Payment: Payment info (whether it's paid or cash on delivery).
**ðŸš€ DevOps and Deployment**
* Docker:
Dockerize the backend with a Dockerfile.
Use Docker Compose to run both the frontend and backend locally for testing.
* CI/CD:
Set up a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions or GitLab CI) to automate deployment and tests.
Kubernetes (optional):
Scale up if needed by creating Kubernetes deployment files for the backend (API).
* ðŸŽ¨ Design Tips:
Vintage Moroccan vibes for food ordering.
Use warm colors (earthy tones like beige, brown, and orange).
Use traditional patterns (e.g., geometric zellige tiles) in the UI.
Typography: Opt for something cursive or handwritten to evoke a homemade, street food vibe.
With this structure, youâ€™ll have a small but fully functional project with fullstack, DevOps practices, and a unique Moroccan touch. It can be easily scaled up later, but right now, itâ€™s focused on one vendor and basic functionality.

Let me know if you'd like help with specific parts (backend models, frontend setup, etc.). Good luck building your project! ðŸš€
